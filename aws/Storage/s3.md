# Storage 

##1. S3

* Store file or object 
* Define at region level 
* Naming convention
    * No uppercase
    * No underscore 
    * 3-63 char long 
    * Not an IP 
    * Must start with lowercase letter or number
* Objects (files) have Key. Key is the FULL path
* No concept of **directorie**
* Size:
    * Max size of object **5TB**
    * If uploading more thant 5GB, must use **mutli-part upload**
* Object have metadata (list of test key / value pairs)
* Object have Tag (Unicode key / value pair upt to 10), useful for security and lifecycle
* Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
* Support any formats (bin, parquet, csv, ...)

1. **Tiers**

2. **Lifecycle Rules** !!!
* Set of rules to move data between different tiers, to save storage cost
* Ex: General Purpose => Infrequent Access => Glacier

3. **Versionning**
* Enable in bucket level 
* Same Key overwrite will increment the **verion**: 1, 2, 3
* It is best practice to version your buckets 
    * Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
    * Easy roll back to previous version
* Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version **null**
* You can **suspend** versioning

4. **Cross Region Replication**
* Move bucket from one region to another
* Must enable versioning (**source and destination**)
* Buckets must be in diffrent AWS regions
* Can be in different accounts
* Copying is async 
* Must give proper IAM permissions to S3

5. **Tags**
* How do you verify if a file has already been uploaded to S3
* Names work, but how are you sure the file is **exactly** the same ?
* For this, you can use AWS ETags:
    * For simple uploads (less than **5GB**), its the **MD5** hash
    * For multi-part uploads, it's more complicated, no need to know the algorithm
* Using Etag, we can ensure **integrity** of files
