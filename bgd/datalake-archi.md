## Best practice

- Use Event-Sourcing to facilitate backups (store now, analyze later)
- Layer data based on userâ€™s skills (data analytic, engendering, ...)
- Keep the Datalake open (avoiding vendor lock-in, or overbalance on a single tool or database)
- Plan for performance
- See the [link](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/four-principles-data-lake-architecture)

## Architecture (patterns)

- **Datalake**
  - Pros:
    - Store raw data 
    - Store different type of data (structured, semi and non-structured)
    - Allows flexibly
  - Cons: 
    - Multiples issues of data quality
    
- **Lambda**
  - Batch layer
  - Realtime layer 
  - Serving layer
  
- **Kappa**
  - Simplify lamda architecture by fusionionning batch realtime layers 
 
- **Partitioning**
  - Enables efficient data filtering and retrieval, as queries can skip irrelevant partitions during processing,
    which is also referred to as data pruning.
  - Choose frequently used columns 
  - Two types
    - Static 
    - Dynamic 
  - Partition size should be balanced to avoid data skew 

- **Bucketing**
  - Bucketing improves query performance by grouping similar data together and reducing the number of files 
    to scan during processing 
  - Reduce the number of files to scan and improves data locality 
  
## Example of data ingestion in Uber
- Decouple storage from query layer, each can be scaled independently
- Two dataset types
    - Append-only
    - Append-plus-update
    
- Challenges
    - Not read the hole dataset
    - Spread across multiple files within partitions to leverage high parallelism during writes and in case
    of files updates, limiting write footprint only to the files containing these updates
    - For efficient updates: lookup tool (<u>lookup table</u>) for location of the data with the Big data platform

    - The indexing system that maybe used **HBase** or **Cassandra** 
    - Hbase vs Cassandra
      - HBase permits consistency on reads and writes. No need to tweak consistency parameter as is done in cassandra
      - HBase provides automatic re-balancing of tables within a cluster
