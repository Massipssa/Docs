# API Gateway 

- Fully managed service
- Allows to easily publish, create, maintain, monitor and secure your API. 

## Endpoint Types

- Edge-Optimized (default)
  - Requests are routed through the CloudFront Edge locations (improves latency)
  - The API Gateway still lives in only one region 
- Regional
  - For clients within the same region 
  - Cloud manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching strategies and distribution)
- Private 
  - Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
