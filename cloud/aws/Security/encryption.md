# Encryption

1. Encryption on fly (SSL)
    * Data encrypted before sending and decrypted when received by the server
    * To protect against the MIMD attack
    * SSL certificates help to secure HTTPS
2. Server side encryption at rest

3. Client side encryption
    * Data encrypted by the client and **never** decrypted by the server
