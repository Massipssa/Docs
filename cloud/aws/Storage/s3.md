# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Store file or object 
- Define at region level 
  - Naming convention
  - No uppercase 
  - No underscore 
  - 3-63 char long 
  - Not an IP 
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Objects (files) have Key. Key is the FULL path
- No concept of **directories**
- Size:
  - Max size of object **5TB**
  - If uploading more thant 5GB, must use **mutli-part upload**
- Object have metadata (list of test key / value pairs)
- Object have Tag (Unicode key / value pair upt to 10), useful for security and lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
- Support any formats (bin, parquet, csv, ...)

## Storage classes

- **Standard**
  - High availability and durability (>= 3 AZ)
  - Designed for frequent access
  - Suitable for most workloads
- **Standard-IA**
  - Less frequently and rapid access  
- One zone infrequent access 
  - Like **Standard-IA** but data is stored in single AZ 
  - Cost less 20% than standard-IA 
- Intelligent-Tiering  
  - Some time accessed frequently and sometime not
- Glacier Options
  - **Glacier Instant retrieval:** provides long-term archiving data with instant retrieval time for your data
  - **Glacier Flexible retrieval:** ideal storage class for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs 
  flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use case.Can be up minutes
  or up to 12 hours 
  - **Glacier Deep retrieval:** cheapest storage class and designed for customers that retain data sets for 7-10 years
  or longer to meet customer needs and regulator compliance requirements. The standard retrieval time is 12 hours, and
  the bulk retrieval time is 48 hours


## Versioning

- Enable in bucket level 
- Same Key overwrite will increment the **version**: 1, 2, 3
- It is best practice to version your buckets 
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  - Easy roll back to previous version
- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version **null**
- You can **suspend** versioning

## Management Lifecycle Rules

- Set of rules to move data between different tiers, to save storage cost
- Can be used in conjunction with versionning 
- Can be applied to the current versions and previous versions
- Ex: General Purpose => Infrequent Access => Glacier

## Object Lock

- Compliance mode 
- Governance mode 

## S3 Replication (Cross Region Replication)

- Move bucket from one region to another
- Must enable versioning (**source and destination**)
- Buckets must be in different AWS regions
- Can be in different accounts
- Copying is async 
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3

## MFA delete

- Ensures users cannot delete objects from a bucket unless they provided their MFA code

## Tags

- How do you verify if a file has already been uploaded to S3
- Names work, but how are you sure the file is **exactly** the same ?
- For this, you can use AWS ETags:
  - For simple uploads (less than **5GB**), it's the **MD5** hash
  - For multi-part uploads, it's more complicated, no need to know the algorithm
- Using a tag, we can ensure **integrity** of files
- Delete markers aren't replicated by default

## Performance 

- Prefix: spread our reads across multiple prefixes 
- KMS come in with limits 
- Multipart upload
- S3 Byte range fetches 

## Encryption 

- **In transit** 
  - SSL/TLS 
  - HTTPS 
- **At rest: Server-side encryption**
  - SSE-S3: aws manage the encryption 
  - SSE-KMS
  - SSE-C: customer provide keys 
- **At rest: Client-side encryption**
  - You encrypt your files before uploading them to S3  

## Security
- Server-side encryption 
- ACLs: works on individual object level
- Bucket policies: works on entire bucket level
