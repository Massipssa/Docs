# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Store file or object
- Define at region level
  - Naming convention
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 char long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Objects (files) have Key. Key is the FULL path
- No concept of **directories**
- Size:
  - Max size of object **5TB**
  - If uploading more thant **5GB**, must use **mutli-part upload**
- Object have metadata (list of test key-value pairs)
- Object have Tag (Unicode key-value pair up to 10), useful for security and lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
- Support any formats (bin, parquet, csv, ...)

## Storage classes

- **Standard**
  - High availability and durability (>= 3 AZ)
  - Designed for frequent access
  - Suitable for most workloads
- **Standard-IA**
  - Less frequently and rapid access  
- **One Zone Infrequent Access**
  - Like **Standard-IA** but data is stored in single AZ
  - Cost less 20% than standard-IA
- **Intelligent-Tiering**  
  - Some time accessed frequently and sometime not
- **Glacier**
  - **Glacier Instant Retrieval:** provides long-term archiving data with instant retrieval time for your data
  - **Glacier Flexible Retrieval:** ideal storage class for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs
    - Expedited (1 to 5 minutes)
    - Standard (3 to 5 hours)
    - Bulk (5 to 12 hours)
  flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use case.Can be up minutes
  or up to 12 hours
  - **Glacier Deep Retrieval:** cheapest storage class and designed for customers that retain data sets for 7-10 years
    - Standard (12 hours)
    - Bulk (48 hours)
  or longer to meet customer needs and regulator compliance requirements. The standard retrieval time is 12 hours, and
  the bulk retrieval time is 48 hours

## Versioning

- Enable in bucket level
- Same Key overwrite will increment the **version**: 1, 2, 3
- It is best practice to version your buckets
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  - Easy roll back to previous version
- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version **null**
- You can **suspend** versioning

## Management Lifecycle Rules

- Set of rules to move data between different tiers, to save storage cost
- Can be used in conjunction with versionning
- Can be applied to the current versions and previous versions
- Ex: General Purpose => Infrequent Access => Glacier
- **Transaction Actions**: configure objects to transition to another storage class
- **Expiration Actions**: configure object to expire (delete) after some time
- Rules can be created for a certain prefix (s3://bucketname/test/*)
- Rules can be created for certain objects Tags

## Object Lock

- Compliance mode
- Governance mode
- Legal Hold ??

## S3 Replication (Cross Region Replication)

- Move bucket from one region to another
- Must enable versioning (**source and destination**)
- Buckets must be in different AWS regions
- Can be in different accounts
- Copying is async
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- Only new objects are replicated, to enable for existing object use **S3 Batch Replication**

## MFA delete

- Ensures users cannot delete objects from a bucket unless they provided their MFA code

## Tags

- How do you verify if a file has already been uploaded to S3
- Names work, but how are you sure the file is **exactly** the same ?
- For this, you can use AWS ETags:
  - For simple uploads (less than **5GB**), it's the **MD5** hash
  - For Multi-part uploads, it's more complicated, no need to know the algorithm
- Using a tag, we can ensure **integrity** of files
- Delete markers aren't replicated by default

## Requester Pays

- The requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket
- The requester must be authenticated in AWS (cannot be anonymous)

## Event Notifications

- React to events that are happening in S3 (create, delete, ... object)
- We need to have IAM Permissions
- Targets: SNS, SQS and Lambda Function
- EventBridge can also be used

## Performance

- Multi-Part upload
- S3 Transfer accelerator
- Byte Range Fetch
- S3 Select & Glacier Select
- S3 Batch Operations: perform bulk operations on existing S3 objects with a single request, example:
  - modify object metadata
  - Copy objects between S3 buckets
  - Encrypt un-encrypted objects
  - Modify ACLs, tags
  - Restore objects from S3 Glacier
- Prefix: spread our reads across multiple prefixes
- KMS come in with limits
- Multipart upload
- S3 Byte range fetches
- S3 Analytics ??

## Security

## Encryption

- **At rest: Server-side encryption**
  - SSE-S3:
    - Encryption using keys handled, managed and owned by AWS
    - Object is encrypted server-side
    - Encryption type is AES-256
    - Must set header **"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"**
    - Enabled by default for new buckets and new objects
  - SSE-KMS
    - Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS KMS
    - ??
  - SSE-C: customer provide keys
- **At rest: Client-side encryption**
  - You encrypt your files before uploading them to S3  

- **In transit**
  - SSL/TLS
  - HTTPS

## ACLs

- Works on individual object level

## Bucket policies

- Works on entire bucket level

## S3 Object Lambda

- Use to change object before it is retrieved by the caller application
