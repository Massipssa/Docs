# BigQuery

- Fully managed serverless data warehouse
- Provide storage and analytics at the same time
- Deals with
  - Storage:
    - Data is stored in structured table
    - Replicated, distributed storage
  - Ingestion
  - Querying
- Pay-as-you go pricing model
- Encryption at the rest by default
- Supports ***SQL***
- Near real-time query analysis
- Accept batch and streaming
- Can be used for storage and analysis
- Replicated and durable
- Is columnar
- Built-in machine learning models
- Supports repeated columns and nested schema 

## IAM

- Control can be done by project, dataset and view
- Has predefined roles ...
- Sharding dataset
- View can be used to restrict access to some data
- Supports primitives roles for Project Level access

## Cache

- Enabled by default
- Are per user
- No charge for queries executed from the cache

## Partition

- Types
  - Ingestion-time partitioned
  - Partition by specific timestamp/date column
  - Range partition (integer-type colum)
- Best practice is to ensure that partition column is always invoked in querying

## Clustering 
- ?? 

## UDF

- Combine JavaScript with SQL
- Allow more complex operations like loops, combination, ...

## Princing

- Charged for: Storage, Querying and Streaming insert
- No charge for Batch Loading
- **Flat rate ??**

## Import and export data to BigQuery

- Load
    - Command
        - ```bq load names.baby_names gs://(YOUR_BUCKET)/names/yob*.txt Name:STRING,Gender:STRING,Number:INTEGER```
- Export
  - BigQuery <=> BigQuery
  - Table's data can only be exported to **GCS** with one of this format csv, json, avro
  - To get data from **Dataproc**, a connector is installed by default in Dataproc and the data will be exported to GSP then to bucket will be read from BigQuey
  - Can only export up to 1 GB
  - Command
    - ```bq extract 'projectid:dataset:table' gc://bucket_name/folder/object_name```

## Monitor & Logging

- Monitor allows to visualize:
  - Metrics (alter on metric)
  - Performance
  - Resource capacity/usage (Slots)
- Logging:
  Who is doing what (show actions history)

- What does colors mean in query details ?

## bq tool

- Create dataset
    ```bq  mk --dataset ds_name```

- Select from table
    ```bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'select * from ds_result.top_qsts' ```


## Bigquery ML

- ML model in two steps:
  - Build the model 
  - Train the model 
- Manually or automatically control hyperparameters
- Supports
  - Supervised 
  - Unsupervised
- Steps 
  - Extract, transform and load data into Bigquery
  - Select and preprocess features
  - Create the model inside Bigquery 
  - Evaluate the performance of evaluated trained model
  - Use the model to make predictions
