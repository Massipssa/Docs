## Cloud services type

Cloud services come in three primary types:

- SaaS (Software as a Service) --> For customers
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) --> For developers

Ideal for strict security or compliance needs (Known also as On-premise)
- **Hybrid Cloud:**  Combines public and private clouds to allow data and applications to move between them.
Offers greater flexibility and optimization
