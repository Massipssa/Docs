# CloudFront

- Fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers
  globally
- It helps reduce latency and provide higher transfer speeds using AWS edge locations
- The only option to add HTTPS to a static website being hosted in an S3 bucket 
- Improves users experience 
- 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
- DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall

## Origins

- S3 Buckets 
  - For distributing files and caching them at the edge
  - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
- Custom Origin (HTTP)
  - Application Load Balancer 
  - EC2 instance 
  - S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
  - Any Http backend

## CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication 

- CloudFront 
  - Global Edge network 
  - Files are cached for TTL (maybe a day)
  - Great for static content that must be available everywhere 
- S3 Cross Region Replication 
  - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen 
  - Files are updated in near real-time
  - Read only 
  - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

## Pricing

- The cost of data out per edge location varies
- Three price classes 
  - **Price Class All:** all regions - best performance 
  - **Price Class 200:** most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions 
  - **Price Class 100:** only the least expensive regions 


## Cache Invalidation

- In case you update the back-end origin, CloudFront doesn't know about it and will only get the refreshed content after
  the TTL has expired 
- However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (tus bypassing the TTL) by performing a CloudFront invalidation 
- You can in validate all files (*) or a special path (/pathname/*)
