# Intro to ml

## Type

- Supervised: Task-driven and identify a **goal**
  - Classification:
    - Binary classification
    - Multiclass
    - Regression  
- Unsupervised: Data-driven and identify a pattern **pattern**
- Reinforcement

## Flow

1. Ask right questions
   - Define end goal, starting point and how to achieve goal
   - Understand the features in data
   - Identify critical features
2. Prepare data
   - Data rule #3: Accurately predicting rare events is difficult
   - Data rule #4: track how you manipulate data
3. Select the algorithm
   - Algorithm decision factors
     - Learning type (supervised or unsupervised)
     - Result (regression or classification)
     - Complexity
     - Basic vs enhanced
4. Training the model
5. Testing the model

## Data

- Labeled
- Unlabeled

It is typically numeral or categorical:

- Numerical such as age, income
- Categorical such as gender
- Ordinal: list of values (small, medium and large)

To type of datasets are used

- Training: to train model
- Validation
- Test: to evaluate the

Data --> Information --> Knowledge

- **Information**: the data that had been interpreted and manipulated and has some inference for the users
- **Knowledge**: combination of inferred information, experiences, learning, and insights.
