## Compute

### App Engine

- Is Paas (Platform as Service)
- Auto scaling and and Load-Balancing
- Two environments:
    - Standard
    - Flexible

### Compute Engine

- Is IaaS (Infrastructure as Service)
- Scalable and high perforamnce VMs
- Two types instances group:
    - Managed: collection of instances that are identical
    - Unmanaged: collection of instances with different config

### Kubernetes Engine

- Managed orchestrated environnement for containerrized app
- Serverless
- Benefits:
    - Load Balancing intergrated
    - Automtic upgrade
    - Logging and monitoring is handled by stackdriver
    - ...

### Cloud Functions

- Runs in response to the event
- Serverless
- Pay for CPU and RAM
- Each function get HTTP endpoint


## Network

### VPC

### Load Balancer

### Cloud CDN

- Accelerate delivery from Compute Engine and Cloud Storage
- Lower latency
